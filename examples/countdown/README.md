# Countdown Example

A simple countdown timer that demonstrates:
- Timer-based commands with `Cmd.after`
- Basic keyboard input handling
- Program termination with `Cmd.quit`

The program counts down from 5 seconds and exits automatically, or can be quit early with 'q' or Ctrl+C.

## Run

```bash
dune exec countdown
```
