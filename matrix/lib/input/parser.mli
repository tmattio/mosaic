(** Incremental input parser.

    Consumes raw terminal bytes and emits user-facing events ({!Event.t}) and
    terminal responses ({!Event.Response.t}) through callbacks. A single parser
    instance drives both streams so callers do not need to run two parsers over
    the same bytes.

    The parser preserves bracketed paste payloads exactly, including empty
    payloads and embedded escape bytes. Invalid or timed-out legacy high bytes
    are interpreted as Meta/Alt bytes by subtracting [0x80] and parsing the
    resulting byte through the normal ESC-prefixed key path.

    {b Warning.} Not thread-safe; use one instance per input source. *)

val create : ?max_paste_bytes:int -> ?paste_idle_timeout:float -> unit -> t
(** [create ~max_paste_bytes ~paste_idle_timeout ()] is a fresh parser with
    empty buffers.

    [max_paste_bytes] is the largest bracketed-paste payload accepted as an
    {!Event.Paste}; it defaults to 16 MiB. A larger payload emits
    {!Event.Error.Paste_too_large} and is discarded through its end marker or
    idle deadline.

    [paste_idle_timeout] is the maximum number of seconds an open paste may
    receive no bytes; it defaults to 5 seconds. The deadline is refreshed by
    progress. Expiry emits {!Event.Error.Paste_timed_out} and drops the captured
    bytes without interpreting them as keys.

    Raises [Invalid_argument] if [max_paste_bytes] is not strictly positive or
    cannot fit in an OCaml byte sequence, or if [paste_idle_timeout] is not
    finite and strictly positive. *)

val set_protocol_context : t -> protocol_context -> unit
(** [set_protocol_context p ctx] sets the protocol context for [p].

    The context affects timeout handling for incomplete protocol replies. It
    does not emit or discard already-buffered data. *)

val protocol_context : t -> protocol_context
(** [protocol_context p] is [p]'s current protocol context. *)

(** {1:feeding Feeding} *)

val feed :
  t ->
  bytes ->
  int ->
  int ->
  now:float ->
  on_event:(Event.t -> unit) ->
  on_response:(Event.Response.t -> unit) ->
  unit
(** [feed p buf off len ~now ~on_event ~on_response] consumes [len] bytes from
    [buf] starting at offset [off].

    Each parsed user event is passed to [on_event]; each terminal response is
    passed to [on_response]. Incomplete escape sequences are buffered and
    combined with subsequent calls. Bracketed paste content is emitted as one
    {!Event.Paste} event when the end marker is received.

    [now] is the current time in seconds since the epoch, used to schedule flush
    deadlines for ambiguous sequences, incomplete escape sequences, and
    incomplete UTF-8 byte sequences. Raises [Invalid_argument] if [off] and
    [len] describe a range outside [buf]. *)

(** {1:draining Draining} *)

val drain :
  t ->
  now:float ->
  on_event:(Event.t -> unit) ->
  on_response:(Event.Response.t -> unit) ->
  unit
(** [drain p ~now ~on_event ~on_response] emits pending input whose deadline has
    passed. A lone {!Event.Key.Escape} only appears after this drain when the
    terminal splits a modifier sequence across reads. A timed-out incomplete
    UTF-8 high byte is emitted through the legacy Meta/Alt path. Call after
    {!deadline} has elapsed. *)

val deadline : t -> float option
(** [deadline p] is the absolute timestamp (seconds since the epoch) at which
    the next {!drain} should fire, or [None] when no drain is scheduled. *)

(** {1:state State} *)

val finish : t -> on_event:(Event.t -> unit) -> unit
(** [finish p ~on_event] finalizes an input source that reached end-of-input. An
    open paste emits {!Event.Error.Unterminated_paste}; an oversized paste
    already reported by {!Event.Error.Paste_too_large} emits no second error.
    All partial bytes are then dropped and [p] is reset. Captured paste bytes
    are never interpreted as keys. *)

val pending : t -> bytes
(** [pending p] is a copy of the incomplete escape/protocol data buffered so
    far. Bytes inside an open paste and bytes buffered for an incomplete UTF-8
    sequence are not included. Useful for diagnostics and tests. *)

val reset : t -> unit
(** [reset p] clears all parser state, dropping any buffered partial sequences
    and capability tracking. *)
