(** Primary-screen viewport state.

    [Primary] models Matrix's primary-screen layout as an inline live viewport
    with static transcript rows above it. It is a pure state machine: it never
    writes to a terminal, mutates a {!Screen.t}, or owns I/O resources.

    The runtime interprets returned plans inside a frame transaction. *)

(** A pending static write.

    [rows] is the exact number of terminal rows consumed by [text]. The caller
    is responsible for computing it. When [preserve_live_region] is [true], the
    write scrolls directly into history without shrinking the live region.
    Preservation is honored only when no static rows sit above the live region
    and every write queued in the same flush preserves; any other layout grows
    the static area as usual so content is never dropped. *)

type cursor_anchor = {
  render_offset : int;

}
(** Primary state derived from a cursor position report.

    [scroll_bottom] is [true] iff the cursor was on the bottom terminal row and

(** [create ~terminal_height ~min_live_height ~render_offset

    rows.

    [min_live_height] is clamped to \[[1];[terminal_height]\]. [render_offset]
    is clamped so the live viewport keeps at least the clamped minimum height.

val anchor_of_cursor :
  terminal_height:int -> row:int -> col:int -> cursor_anchor
(** [anchor_of_cursor ~terminal_height ~row ~col] is the primary state implied
    by a cursor position report.

    [row] and [col] are one-based terminal coordinates. The runtime owns the
    terminal write described by [scroll_bottom]. *)

val render_offset : t -> int
(** [render_offset t] is the number of terminal rows above the live viewport. *)

val static_needs_newline : t -> bool
(** [static_needs_newline t] is [true] iff the next static write must first move
    to a fresh row to avoid continuing a prior mid-line write. *)

val live_region : t -> region
(** [live_region t] is the current live viewport region. *)

val effective_region : t -> region
(** [effective_region t] is the live viewport region that will be in effect
    after pending static writes are flushed.

    This must stay in lockstep with {!flush_static}. *)

val size : t -> width:int -> int * int
(** [size t ~width] is the current live viewport size as [(width, rows)]. *)

val effective_size : t -> width:int -> int * int
(** [effective_size t ~width] is the live viewport size that will be in effect
    after pending static writes are flushed.

val resize : t -> terminal_height:int -> t * plan
(** [resize t ~terminal_height] updates terminal height and clamps the live

    only flags redraw effects. *)

(** [reanchor t ~render_offset ~static_needs_newline] updates the live viewport
    anchor without changing pending static writes. *)

val enqueue_static : t -> static_write -> t
(** [enqueue_static t write] queues [write] for the next static flush. Empty
    text is ignored. Raises [Invalid_argument] if [write.rows < 0]. *)

val replace_static : t -> static_write -> t
(** [replace_static t write] queues an atomic replacement of all static
    primary-screen content for the next flush. The replacement may be empty.
    Raises [Invalid_argument] if [write.rows < 0]. *)

val flush_static : t -> t * plan
(** [flush_static t] plans all pending static writes and returns the updated
    state.

    The returned plan may physically change terminal rows outside the live
    viewport. The runtime must interpret it before rendering the next live
    frame.

    If the live viewport already occupies the full terminal height, static rows
    are scrolled directly into terminal history and the live viewport is left at
    the same size. *)

val clear_static : t -> t * plan
(** [clear_static t] resets primary static state and returns the terminal plan
    for clearing the primary screen. *)

val apply_required_rows :
  t -> active_rows:int -> required_rows:int option -> t * plan * int option
(** [apply_required_rows t ~active_rows ~required_rows] grows the live viewport
    if the current frame needs more rows.

    The returned [int option] is the maximum live viewport height to render.
    [None] means the full live viewport can be rendered. *)

val terminal_cursor_row : t -> live_row:int -> live_height:int -> int
(** [terminal_cursor_row t ~live_row ~live_height] maps a zero-based live
    viewport cursor row to a one-based terminal row, clamped to [live_height].
*)

val default_terminal_cursor_row : t -> live_height:int -> int
(** [default_terminal_cursor_row t ~live_height] is the terminal row used when
    the live cursor has no explicit position in primary mode. *)

val map_mouse_y : t -> int -> int
(** [map_mouse_y t y] maps a one-based terminal mouse row to the live viewport
    coordinate expected by Matrix input handlers. Rows above the live viewport
    map to [-1]. *)
