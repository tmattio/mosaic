(** Debug overlay with runtime telemetry.

    Paints a semi-transparent box in a screen corner showing frame metrics from
    {!Screen.last_metrics}, rolling averages for frame time and interval, and
    per-frame GC statistics from {!Gc.quick_stat}.

    Internal to the Matrix runtime: reachable through
    {!Matrix.set_debug_overlay} and {!Matrix.toggle_debug_overlay}, not exported
    as a standalone module.

    {b Note.} The default theme uses alpha=200 backgrounds. Set
    [respect_alpha=true] in {!Matrix.create} for correct transparency; otherwise
    the overlay renders opaque. *)

(** [on_frame ()] is a callback that draws the overlay onto [screen]'s grid.
    Call once per frame after the UI has painted.

    The callback keeps internal state (rolling averages, GC deltas); reuse the
    same callback for the overlay's lifetime.
    - [corner] anchor position. Defaults to [`Bottom_right].
    - [padding] outer padding in cells.
    - [gap] gap between metric lines.
    - [capacity] maximum number of metric samples retained. *)
