(** Terminal capability detection.

    [Caps] implements a functional capability detection pipeline used by
    {!Terminal}. It combines environment heuristics with active probing and
    never keeps hidden mutable state: capabilities are stored in plain records
    and updated by folding events.

    {2:stage1 Stage 1 -- Environment heuristics}

    {!initial} constructs a baseline {!t} from [$TERM], [$COLORTERM],
    [$KITTY_WINDOW_ID], platform quirks (e.g. Windows ConPTY), and explicit
    overrides such as [MATRIX_FORCE_WCWIDTH] and [MATRIX_FORCE_UNICODE]. This
    stage emits no escape sequences and is safe for non-interactive runs.

    {2:stage2 Stage 2 -- Active probing}

    {!probe} sends a single compound payload that includes cursor save/restore,
    DECRQM queries for private modes (focus, sync, Unicode width, SGR pixels,
    colour-scheme updates, bracketed paste), primary device attributes (DA),
    explicit-width and scaled-text cursor-position queries, XTVersion, CSI u
    (Kitty keyboard), and Kitty graphics queries. iTerm2 proprietary queries are
    appended when [$TERM] contains ["iterm"].

    Responses are parsed through a {!Input.Parser.t} and converted into
    {!Input.Response.capability} values. {!apply_events} folds those into the
    capability record and {!terminal_info}.

    Kitty detection (via XTVersion containing ["kitty"] or [$KITTY_WINDOW_ID])
    immediately promotes all Kitty capabilities. Detection of the Kitty keyboard
    protocol alone (via CSI u query) only sets [kitty_keyboard = true], since
    other terminals may support the keyboard protocol without full Kitty
    compatibility.

    {2:cap_model Capability model}

    The capability record distinguishes between {e detected} capabilities and
    {e policy overrides}:
    - {e Detected capabilities} from probing are monotonic: once a probe
      confirms a feature, it remains enabled.
    - {e Policy overrides} from the environment may disable features that were
      detected or assumed: Windows ConPTY disables Kitty/SIXEL, VS Code terminal
      disables Kitty keyboard/graphics, tmux/screen forces
      [unicode_width = `Wcwidth], [$VHS_RECORD] disables Kitty features for
      recording.

    When [apply_env_overrides] is [true] in {!probe} or {!apply_events}, policy
    overrides are reapplied after each batch of responses.

          ([COLORTERM=truecolor/24bit] or Kitty/ConPTY heuristics). *)

  focus_tracking : bool;
      (** [true] if focus tracking (DECSET/DECRST 1004) is supported or enabled.
      *)
  unicode_width : Text.width_method;
      (** Current Unicode width mode. Reflects both heuristics and any DECRQM
          2027 responses processed so far. Terminals such as Kitty, WezTerm,
          recent iTerm2, and Foot report Unicode width support via DECRQM 2027.
      *)
  sgr_pixels : bool;

          protocol, DECRQM 2031) are supported. *)
  explicit_width : bool;
      (** [true] if the terminal reported explicit cell-width information via
          proprietary cursor-position queries (iTerm2/Foot). *)
  explicit_cursor_positioning : bool;
      (** [true] if the terminal may miscalculate grapheme widths but supports
          reliable cursor positioning. When set, the renderer repositions the
          cursor after each wide grapheme to prevent column drift. Only used
          when {!field-explicit_width} is [false]. *)
  scaled_text : bool;
      (** [true] if the terminal reports support for scaled text sizing (Foot,
          WezTerm and similar, via proprietary queries). *)

          cues). *)
}
(** The type for terminal capability sets.

    Boolean fields from probing are monotonic: once a probe confirms a feature,
    subsequent probes do not disable it. Policy overrides (see {!apply_events}
    with [apply_env_overrides:true]) may disable features to ensure correct
    behaviour in specific environments.

    The record is intentionally verbose rather than bit-packed to keep debugging
    and conditional branches readable. *)

type terminal_info = { name : string; version : string; from_xtversion : bool }
(** The type for terminal emulator identity.
    - [name] is the terminal program name, taken from XTVersion when available,
      otherwise from [$TERM_PROGRAM].
    - [version] is the version string, taken from XTVersion or
      [$TERM_PROGRAM_VERSION].
    - [from_xtversion] is [true] iff [name] and [version] came from an XTVersion
      response. *)

(** {1:constructors Constructors} *)

val initial : ?provided:t -> term:string -> unit -> t * terminal_info
(** [initial ~provided ~term ()] is the initial capability record and terminal
    metadata.

    When [provided] is [Some caps], returns [caps] unchanged and derives
    {!terminal_info} from the environment
    ([$TERM_PROGRAM]/[$TERM_PROGRAM_VERSION]) using [caps.term] as the baseline.

    When [provided] is [None], constructs a baseline from [term] and environment
    heuristics, then applies environment overrides such as
    [MATRIX_FORCE_WCWIDTH], [MATRIX_FORCE_UNICODE], [$TERM_PROGRAM], modern
    terminal sync hints, tmux/screen fallbacks, and platform-specific quirks.

    In both cases [terminal_info.from_xtversion] is [false]; XTVersion replies
    processed later via {!apply_events} take precedence. *)

(** {1:events Event processing} *)

val apply_event :
  ?apply_env_overrides:bool ->
  caps:t ->
  info:terminal_info ->
  Input.Response.capability ->
  t * terminal_info
(** [apply_event ~apply_env_overrides ~caps ~info event] processes a single
    capability [event] and is [(caps', info')] with the updated records.

    This is the callback-friendly version of {!apply_events} that avoids list
    allocation. [apply_env_overrides] defaults to [false].

    See also {!apply_events}. *)

val apply_events :
  ?apply_env_overrides:bool ->
  caps:t ->
  info:terminal_info ->
  Input.Response.capability list ->
  t * terminal_info
(** [apply_events ~apply_env_overrides ~caps ~info events] folds capability
    [events] into the records and is [(caps', info')].

    Events are processed in order; later events win when they provide strictly
    more information (e.g. a Unicode-width DECRQM replacing an environment
    guess).

    When [apply_env_overrides] is [true], environment heuristics are reapplied
    after folding. Defaults to [false].

    See also {!apply_event}. *)

(** {1:probing Probing} *)

val probe :
  ?timeout:float ->
  ?apply_env_overrides:bool ->
  on_event:(Input.t -> unit) ->
  read_into:(bytes -> int -> int -> int) ->
  wait_readable:(timeout:float -> bool) ->
  send:(string -> unit) ->
  parser:Input.Parser.t ->
  caps:t ->
  info:terminal_info ->
  unit ->
  t * terminal_info
(** [probe ~timeout ~apply_env_overrides ~on_event ~read_into ~wait_readable
     ~send ~parser ~caps ~info ()] runs the active probing stage and is
    [(caps', info')] with the refined records.

    Emits a compound query payload built from [caps.term] using [send].
    Repeatedly waits for input using [wait_readable], reads into a temporary
    buffer via [read_into], feeds bytes into [parser], collects capability
    events, and applies them with {!apply_events}. User input events (keys,
    mouse, etc.) are forwarded to [on_event] so they are not lost during
    probing. A [read_into] result of [0] stops probing because it denotes
    permanent end-of-input.

    Using the caller's [parser] (rather than an internal one) ensures that
    partial escape sequences spanning the probe boundary are not lost.

    Stops when all three conditions are met:
    - explicit-width information is available (either
      [caps.explicit_width = true] or a new probe response),
    - scaled-text information is available (either [caps.scaled_text = true] or
      a new probe response),
    - at least one device-attributes (DA) response has been seen.

    Probing also terminates after [timeout] seconds (default [0.2];
    non-negative).

    When [apply_env_overrides] is [true], environment overrides are reapplied
    after each batch of responses to keep forced policies (e.g. tmux wcwidth) in
    effect even if probes report richer capabilities. Defaults to [false].

    The cursor is saved and restored as part of the payload. Probing is
    idempotent and monotonic: running [probe] multiple times can only add
    capabilities or refine {!terminal_info}, never remove information.

    {b Note.} Callers are responsible for ensuring that [read_into],
    [wait_readable], and [send] interact with the same underlying descriptor and
    do not interfere with normal input processing. *)

val build_probe_payload : string -> string
(** [build_probe_payload term] is the compound probe query string for the given
    [$TERM] value. The payload includes cursor save/restore, DECRQM queries, DA,
    cursor-position probes, XTVersion, CSI u, and Kitty graphics queries. iTerm2
    proprietary queries are appended when [term] contains ["iterm"]. *)
