(** CSS Grid item placement algorithm.

    Implements the 8.5 Grid Item Placement Algorithm from the CSS Grid
    specification, which determines the final position of each grid item within
    the implicit grid.

    {1 Algorithm Overview}

    The placement algorithm processes grid items in four phases:

    + Place items with definite positions in both axes
    + Place items with definite secondary axis positions
    + Implicit grid sizing (handled by earlier estimate)
    + Auto-place remaining items

    The algorithm operates on a {!Cell_occupancy.t} matrix that tracks which
    cells are occupied and dynamically expands the implicit grid as needed. It
    respects [grid-auto-flow] settings (row/column, dense/sparse) and resolves
    named grid lines via {!Named.t}.

    {1 Coordinate Systems}

    Uses origin-zero coordinates where explicit grid tracks are numbered from 0.
    Negative implicit tracks have negative indices; positive implicit tracks
    extend beyond the explicit grid. See {!Grid_track_counts} for coordinate
    system details.

    {1 Integration}

    Called by the grid layout algorithm after computing grid size estimates.
    Populates [items] list and [cell_occupancy_matrix] with placed items. The
    cell occupancy matrix tracks both placement state (definite vs. auto) and
    implicit grid growth. *)

  (module Tree.LAYOUT_PARTIAL_TREE with type t = 'tree) ->
  cell_occupancy_matrix:Cell_occupancy.t ->
  items:Grid_item.t list ref ->
  tree:'tree ->

(** [place_grid_items (module Tree) ~cell_occupancy_matrix ~items ~tree
     ~parent_node ~grid_auto_flow ~align_items ~justify_items
     ~named_line_resolver] places all grid items into the grid.

    Processes children of [parent_node] in four phases: definite placement,
    definite secondary axis, implicit grid expansion, and auto-placement.
    Mutates [cell_occupancy_matrix] to track occupancy and expand implicit grid.
    Accumulates placed items into [items] in reverse order then reverses at end.

    The algorithm:

    - Phase 1: Items with both axes definite are placed directly
    - Phase 2: Items with secondary axis definite search along primary axis
    - Phase 3: Implicit grid sizing is already handled by pre-sizing
    - Phase 4: Remaining items are auto-placed using [grid_auto_flow] strategy

    Dense auto-flow always searches from the grid start. Sparse auto-flow
    continues from the last placed item's position. Items are filtered to
    exclude [display: none] and [position: absolute] children.

    Preconditions:

    - [cell_occupancy_matrix] pre-sized via grid size estimate
    - [items] is empty or will be cleared
    - [named_line_resolver] initialized with template and explicit counts *)
