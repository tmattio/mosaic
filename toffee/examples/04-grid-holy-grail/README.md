# `04-grid-holy-grail`

Implements the classic “holy grail” page layout using CSS Grid: header, left
sidebar, content, right sidebar, and footer arranged in a 3×3 grid.

```bash
dune exec ./examples/04-grid-holy-grail/main.exe
```

## Highlights

- Uses `display = Grid` with explicit rows and columns.
- Demonstrates `fr` tracks and fixed pixel tracks.
- Places items with `grid_row` / `grid_column` using line and span placements.
