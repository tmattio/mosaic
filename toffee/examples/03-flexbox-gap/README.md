# `03-flexbox-gap`

Three fixed-size children laid out in a row with a horizontal gap between them.
This shows how flex gaps work without extra spacer nodes.

```bash
dune exec ./examples/03-flexbox-gap/main.exe
```

## Highlights

- Flex container with `gap` applied on the main axis.
- Simple fixed-size children using length-based dimensions.
- Uses `print_tree` to inspect the entire layout tree.
