  "A modern terminal UI framework for OCaml with React-inspired hooks"
description:
  "Mosaic is a high-performance terminal UI framework that brings React's component model and hooks to terminal applications through OCaml 5's algebraic effects. It provides a direct-style API with hooks like use_state and use_effect, a rich component library, and supports both React-style and Elm Architecture patterns. Built on Matrix for terminal I/O and Toffee for CSS layouts."
