(** Eio-based runtime for {!Matrix}.

    [Matrix_eio] provides an Eio-native event loop for terminal applications.
    Use {!create} to build an {!Matrix.app} with Eio-backed I/O, then pass it to
    {!Matrix.run}. All other Matrix functions ({!Matrix.prepare},
    {!Matrix.submit}, {!Matrix.grid}, etc.) work unchanged.

(** [create ~sw ~clock ~stdin ~stdout ()] is a live {!Matrix.app} with
    Eio-backed I/O.

    Equivalent to {!Matrix.create} but integrates with the Eio scheduler: the
    event loop yields to other Eio fibers while waiting for terminal input. The
    application is automatically closed when [sw] is released. Permanent EOF
    from [stdin] finalizes pending parser state and closes the application
    without polling the source again. The app owns its SIGWINCH disposition and
    restores the previous disposition before releasing backend resources.
    Construction is transactional: a probe, cursor query, attachment, or initial
    output failure restores raw mode and closes any partial application before
    propagating the original exception.

    The mandatory parameters are:
    - [sw] — Eio switch controlling the application lifetime. The app is closed
      when [sw] is released.
    - [clock] — Eio clock for frame timing and input timeouts. Typically
      [Eio.Stdenv.clock env].
    - [stdin] — Eio source for terminal input (typically [env#stdin]).
    - [stdout] — Eio sink for terminal output (typically [env#stdout]).

    All optional parameters match {!Matrix.create}; see its documentation for
    details.

    [signal_handlers] keeps {!Matrix.create}'s meaning — the app owns
    SIGTERM/SIGINT/SIGQUIT/SIGABRT/SIGHUP until close and prior dispositions
    are restored — but termination is handled Eio-natively: the signal handler
    only records the signal, and the event loop closes the application from a
    fiber (within its regular 50ms poll) before exiting with [128 + signum].
    Running the teardown inside the signal handler would perform Eio effects
    without an effect handler on the stack. *)
