# to do

## matrix

example 11-counter:
- doesn't display bottom border
- cursor is displayed

example 12-installer: output displays above the prompt and interleaves static and dynamic content

## mosaic

example 11-form: cannot tab to change focus

example 14-selection: text selection doesn't work in Document Section and Code Example boxes when terminal is zoomed out. Works when zoomed in. Selection works in scroll_box content at any zoom level.

example x-dashboard: canvas seems to draw outside its bounds
