(** Mutable cell-level drawing surface.

    A canvas is a {!Renderable.t} backed by a {!Matrix_grid.t} that the caller
    draws into directly. The grid is resized to match the node's layout
    dimensions at the start of each render pass. On render the canvas blits its
    grid to the parent at the node's position.

    Use {!draw_text}, {!fill_rect}, {!draw_box}, {!draw_line}, or {!set_cell} to
    draw into the canvas. Drawing changes persist between frames. To draw at
    render time, register a callback with {!set_on_draw}; the callback fires
    after auto-resize each pass. Combine with [~live:true] on the renderable for
    per-frame animation. For one-shot or event-driven drawing, call
    {!request_render} after drawing to schedule a re-render.

    In the declarative Vnode system, use {!Vnode.canvas}. *)

(** [create ~parent ()] is a canvas node attached to [parent].

    The internal grid starts at 1x1 and is resized to match the node's layout
    dimensions on the first render pass. It uses the width computation method of
    the screen the canvas renders into.

    Optional parameters:
    - [index] is the child index within [parent]. Defaults to appending at the
      end.
    - [id] is the node identifier. Defaults to [None].
    - [style] is the layout style. Defaults to the empty style.
    - [visible] controls node visibility. Defaults to [true].
    - [z_index] is the stacking order. Defaults to [0].
    - [opacity] is the compositing opacity. Defaults to [1.0].
    - [respect_alpha] controls alpha blending {e within} the canvas grid.
      Defaults to [false]. The compositing step to the parent always respects
      source alpha regardless of this flag.

(** [node t] is the underlying renderable for [t]. *)

(** {1:dimensions Dimensions} *)

val width : t -> int
(** [width t] is the grid width of [t] in cells.

    Starts at [1] and is updated to match layout dimensions at the start of each

    reflects the current layout dimensions. *)

val height : t -> int
(** [height t] is the grid height of [t] in cells.

    render pass. Inside {!set_on_draw} and {!set_on_resize} callbacks the value
    reflects the current layout dimensions. *)

(** {1:drawing Drawing}

    Drawing operations write into the canvas grid. Changes persist between
    frames. Drawing does {b not} auto-schedule a re-render; call
    {!request_render} when done, or use {!set_on_draw} for render-time drawing.

    See {!Matrix_grid.set_cell} for full semantics.

    Optional parameters:

    callback.

    [cb] fires each render pass, after the grid has been auto-resized. [~delta]
    is the elapsed time in milliseconds since the last frame. {!width} and
    {!height} reflect the current layout dimensions inside [cb]. Content from
    previous frames persists in the grid; call {!clear} first for full redraws.

    {b Note.} Combine with [~live:true] on the renderable for per-frame
    animation. *)

val set_on_resize : t -> (t -> unit) option -> unit
(** [set_on_resize t cb] registers [cb] as the resize callback for [t],
    replacing any previously registered callback. [None] clears the callback.

    [cb] fires when the canvas grid is resized due to layout changes. The grid
    has already been resized when [cb] is called; use {!width} and {!height} to
    read the new dimensions. When both a resize callback and a draw callback are
    registered, the resize callback is called first in the same render pass. *)

val request_render : t -> unit
(** [request_render t] schedules a re-render of [t].

    Call this after drawing into the canvas outside of a draw callback to make

    or inside a {!set_on_draw} callback (which already runs inside a render
    pass). *)

(** {1:properties Properties} *)

val set_respect_alpha : t -> bool -> unit
(** [set_respect_alpha t v] enables or disables alpha blending within the canvas
    grid of [t].

val respect_alpha : t -> bool
(** [respect_alpha t] is [true] iff alpha blending is enabled within the canvas
