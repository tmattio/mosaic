(** Grapheme-aware text editing buffer.

    terms of Unicode grapheme clusters. Content may contain newlines for
    multi-line editing. *)

(** The type for mutable editing buffers. *)

(** {1:helpers Helpers} *)

val strip_newlines : string -> string

    initial content is [initial], with cursor at the end.

    [max_length] is the maximum number of grapheme clusters the buffer may hold.
    [initial] is truncated to [max_length] grapheme clusters if it exceeds that
    limit. [max_length] defaults to [1000] and is clamped to [>= 0].

    [width_method] controls how grapheme display widths are computed. Defaults
    to [`Unicode].

    [tab_width] is the display width of tab characters. Defaults to [2] and is
    clamped to [>= 1].
